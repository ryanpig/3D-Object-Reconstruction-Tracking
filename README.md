# 3D-Object-Reconstruction-Tracking

Goal: Reconstruct 3D object in multi camera views and tracking their movement.

Approach:
- Using Silhouette-based approach to reconstruct objects into voxels
- Tracking objects by applying K-mean to cluster voxels and comparing color histogram of corresponding objects.
